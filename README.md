# Music Genre Classification Using Deep Neural Networks

This is a deep learning project that classifies music genres using Deep Neural Networks. It uses TensorFlow, Keras, Librosa, Numpy and Pandas libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to install the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Librosa
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage

You can use 'main.ipynb' file to run this project for yourself.

If you want to use a webapp then you can run 'main.py' file which will start a server on your localhost.

The webapp is using flask.

## Results

The accuracy of the model was evaluated using the test dataset, and it achieved an accuracy of 76%.
